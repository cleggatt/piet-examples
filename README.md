# piet-examples
Some basic Piet examples

1. `count-straight.ppm`. Adds two numbers together. Note that this does not terminate correctly - this was intentional, to keep the example simple.
2. `count-straight-stop.ppm`. As (1), but it terminates. 
3. `count-square-stop.ppm`. As (2) but as a more Piet-like square.
4. `count-loop.ppm`. As (3), but loops to count infinitely.
